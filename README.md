# MLB-Stats-Bot

A bot to help the investment community I'm in to keep track of players they are invested in. Plans to track all stats regarding a certain player tracked in discord.
Discord will be the central location of the bot with commands to track, untrack, and view total stats for a specified amount of time. Utilizes a MLB Stats API and translates that
to discord.
